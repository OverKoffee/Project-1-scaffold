Supra Coders SDI31 - Project 1
Author: Dustin

DOWNLOAD & RUN INSTRUCTIONS:
On the repository's main page, https://github.com/OverKoffee/SDI31-Project-1 ,
click the down arrow on the green button titled "<> Code",
then click Download ZIP. Extract the ZIP file, and open index.html to run the application.

HOW TO USE:
On the index.html (homepage), click "Add New Card" to begin adding cards to your flashcard deck. From there, you may enter a word to add and click "Fetch". Then, a form to populate the "front" and "back" of the card will appear, AND, if that word exists in the dictionary API, it will populate those front and back fields for you.

Once you have added several cards and are ready to review them, navigate back to the homepage and click "Start Reviewing". The idea here is that you will read the sentence containing the word you wanted to learn. Once you have read the sentence, click "Show Answer" which will reveal the back card. From there, you may decide if you understood the sentence with your new word or not. If you did, click "Mark Learned", but if you didn't, click "Next Card" and it will skip that card, putting it back into the stack to review.

Good luck!
