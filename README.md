Supra Coders SDI31 - Project 1
Author: Dustin

DOWNLOAD & RUN INSTRUCTIONS:
On the repository's main page, https://github.com/OverKoffee/SDI31-Project-1 ,
click the down arrow on the green button titled "<> Code",
then click Download ZIP. Extract the ZIP file, and open index.html to run the application.

HOW TO USE:
On the index.html (homepage), click "Add New Card" to begin adding cards to your flashcard deck. From there, you may enter a word to add and click "Fetch". Then, a form to populate the "front" and "back" of the card will appear, AND, if that word exists in the dictionary API, it will populate those front and back fields for you.

Once you have added several cards and are ready to review them, navigate back to the homepage and click "Start Reviewing". The idea here is that you will read the sentence containing the word you wanted to learn. Once you have read the sentence, click "Show Answer" which will reveal the back card. From there, you may decide if you understood the sentence with your new word or not. If you did, click "Mark Learned", but if you didn't, click "Next Card" and it will skip that card, putting it back into the stack to review.

Good luck!

USER STORY:

The user will go to the webpage, select Add or Review.

ADD:
Will have a text field to insert the word to add to their review deck: - after setting the word to be learned (added to the deck), - a default front card appears with a default "example sentence" - this can be replaced if the user inputs their own contextual sentence - a default back card appears with a default definition of the word

REVIEW:
Front card text appears with the sentence containing word to be learned - the user will decide if they understand it or don't - if user chooses "Mark Learned", the card is removed from review stack - if user chooses "Next Card", the card returns to the review stack
